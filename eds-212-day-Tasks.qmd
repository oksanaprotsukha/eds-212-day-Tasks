-   In your Quarto document, find the derivative expression and slope at the indicated value for each the following functions in R (each in a separate code chunk).

    1.  Find the slope of f(x)=x2 at x=3

    2.  Find the slope of P(a)=2(3a+2)4−5 at a=1.2

```{r}
fx = D(expression(x ^ 2), "x")
x <- 3

eval(fx)
```

```{r}
# P(a)=2(3a+2)^4 -5 at a = 1.2

fx = D(expression(2 * (3 * a + 2)^4 - 5), "a")
a <- 1.2

eval(fx)
```
